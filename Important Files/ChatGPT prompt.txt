I worked on a youtube api data gathering project and i created a streamlit web app of the same.
Where the user provides a api key and channel id and can retreive any channel data in the whole world 
and can also download the data in a csv format.

Step by Step flow

1. Create a new environment to work in this project
2. I used channels, playlistItems and Videos from the youtube api reference to retrieve the relevant data
3. Using Channels, I extracted channel statistics like views, subscribers, and number of videos and also uploads playlist id
4. With the playlist id as an input to the playlist items, i retreived the video ids of all the videos
5. Using video ids as an input in videos, i fetched the video meta data like video title, description, published_at, tags, 
   video_duration, channel_name, views, likes, favorites, comments and then converted to a dataframe
6. Created a streamlit app using st.form, where user provides their own api key and channel id and can download the dataset in a csv format one channel at a time.


Data Cleaning:

The API provides the data in JSON format, the data relevant for the project is in nested dictionaries, so retrieving it was quite a task
and use get() method to suppress the errors if any, and utilized try and except blocks where necessary 

Created separate functions for channels, playlistItems, and videoIds for readability and find errors easily


Challenges:

1. At max we can only retrieve 50 items from the youtube api at a time
2. Concept of next page token is utilizedm which is provided by youtube api itself, and retrieved remaining details
3. Utilized while loop in the above process, as the number of items are completely dependent on the channel and varies from channel to channel
4. All the exceptions are taken care using try and except and provided meaningful errors for the user to act on the error if occurred
 like wrong api, no api, wrong channel id, no channel id, and finally channel with zero videos provides a empty dataframe.


The Situation:

You have been hired as a data consultant for school of data science, an online learning platform that teaches data science skills in a project based manner.

The Assigment:
School Of Data Science is nearing its first cohort and they want their students to submit a final project to create a data analytics portfolio.
You have been tasked to develop a streamlit web app where the user (student in this case) provides their own api key and their favorite channel(s) and can retrieve
the data and download as a CSV.

The Objectives:
1. Create a streamlit app to download the data.
2. Create helper videos for students to obtain the api key and channel id
